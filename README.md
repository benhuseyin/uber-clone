# uber-clone

I used Google Maps API for this project. That's why, you should have an account from Google Cloud. After that, you should get your API
from Google Cloud Console. When you get your API, you should add .env file to your project and it should be child of main folder(uber-clone), 
not a grand-child. 

In .env file, you need only one line, and it is GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY = YOUR API KEY without "" & ''.

If you would have any question, feel free to reach out me!
